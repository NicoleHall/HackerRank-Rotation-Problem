## Arrays: Left Rotation

A left rotation operation on an array of size n shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left. For example, if 2 left rotations are performed on array [1,2,3,4,5], then the array would become [3,4,5,1,2].

Given an array of n integers and a number, d, perform d left rotations on the array. Then print the updated array as a single line of space-separated integers.

The method should have an argument that takes 2 integers denoting the respective values of n (the number of integers) and d (the number of left rotations you must perform).

example:
```
def left_rotation(5, 4)
  #code here
end  
```
should return
```
5 1 2 3 4
```
